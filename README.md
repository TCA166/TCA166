### TCA

I'm a polish computer science student.  
For some unknown reason C appeals to me, but when I need to get stuff done I program in other languages like Python or C#.  
In fact I know a fair bit about Python's inner workings because I worked a fair bit with the Python C API.  
Professionally I am a fullstack Python/PHP webdev.  
A lot of my free time projects are video game oriented, and feel free to contribute to them.
