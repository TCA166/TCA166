I'm a polish computer science student.  
I really like low level programming in C or Rust, but profesionally I am a web developer.

## Some of the cool things I did

In my free time I do plenty of programming in a variety of languages, here are the highlights:

### Low level programming

- [mcSavefileParsers](https://github.com/TCA166/mcSavefileParsers) are a set of tools written entirely in C for Minecraft save file parsing and generating 3d models based on savefiles
- [doomMC](https://github.com/TCA166/doomMC) is a Minecraft server written in C++ and C that is meant to host a deathmatch gamemode
- [minecraftBallistics](https://github.com/TCA166/minecraftBallistics) is a set of tools, whose function is really unimportant. What is important is the fact that I used 6 different low level languages and compiled them together!
- [reimagined-adventure](https://github.com/TCA166/reimagined-adventure) is a Linux daemon written entirely in C that monitors contents of a directory based on a config file

### Web development

- [gitWebhook](https://github.com/TCA166/gitWebhook) is a Python module available on PyPI that provides flask blueprints for receiving and processing GitHub and GitLab webhooks
- [openCMS](https://github.com/TCA166/openCMS) is a Python class based framework meant to generate flask based webapps implementing basic CRUD operations
- [fwd](https://github.com/TCA166/fwd) is a PHP webapp for displaying data from this one specific road quality measurment device
- [cdp](https://github.com/TCA166/cdp) is a Java webapp backend I wrote a while back as a part of a recruitment process
- [glowing-eureka](https://github.com/TCA166/glowing-eureka) is the most boring and generic flask webapp imaginable, but demonstrates fairly well the things I do in webdev regularly

### Video game stuff

- [CK3-history-extractor](https://github.com/TCA166/CK3-history-extractor) is a tool for generating a browser encyclopedia from CK3 savefiles
- [Prison-Architect-to-3d](https://github.com/TCA166/Prison-Architect-to-3d-model-converter) is a Python tool for converting Prison Architect savefiles to 3d models
- [CK2-history-extractor](https://github.com/TCA166/CK2-history-extractor) is a Python tool similar to CK3-history-extractor but for CK2
- [gameAnalysis](https://github.com/TCA166/gamesAnalysis) are a set of Jupyter notebooks in within which I do some math regarding some games
